## Theoretical validation of LOVE profile terms

These are the final emotion terms associated to the thirty LOVE 2:5x6 LOVE reference profiles (idealized patterns of the latest observed values):

The thirty terms were theoretically validated and refined (before the experimental validations) over the following 38 simulated emotional sequences (the methodology followed is described in the original paper).

### Series 1.1 and 1.2
Variations starting with an opportunity. Start: Neutral -> Excitement -> Optimism -> ...

Coverage:
- 18 fully coherent paths
- 63 emotional states

#### Series 1.1

### Series 2
Variations starting with a threat. Start: Neutral -> Fear -> ...

Coverage:
- 11 fully coherent paths
- 34 emotional states

#### Series 2.1

Coverage:
- 9 fully coherent paths
- 34 emotional states

#### Series 3.1
Study of the symmetry between anticipated, quick positive/negative rewards.

## Videos used during for the emotional attribution survey

The 48 videos rated during the survey can be found in the folder [./data/original/survey/videos](./../data/original/survey/videos/). These are examples of videos where each of the learned emotions prevailed.
